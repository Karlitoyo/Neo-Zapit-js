**Neo-Zapit** - ***ReadMe***


Neo-Zapit is designed at its core to be simplistic and user friendly with the capability to allow borrowers and lenders to leverage their assets
to create an easier platform to leverage assets within the crypto eco-system. Currently individuals have a lenghty process to exit the market and in many instances do not wish to
sell their positions for loss or for percieved loss. Neo-Zapit will allow them to lock their tokens at an agreed amount and make regular payments to recieve their 
assets back at the loan price. This can create a scenario whereby should the asset increase to a greater amount than originally agreed the 
borrower can still relaise the value which the lender recieves the interest agreed + original capital.

The website development and purpose has been broken down into the detailed sections below -

  > # UX

The UX has been designed to be simple and with the aim of targeting the most financially illiterate individuals
with the purpose of easily encouraging individuals to provide liquidity and connect to the platform. 

## Users

The website has a target audience of both new entrants to banking system and existing users. The age 
profile is based on bank account users within our targeted demographic. Any individual with digital assets can make use of the service.

## Strategy

Initial strategy will be to target crypto users who currently require cash for their assests. This will allow individuals to
retain their assets at the price agreed when taking the loan and to repay the loan to redeem their asset.

## Scope

The Scope of the service is to create financial literacy and encourage saving from a wider range of individuals.
This product can benefit individuals who rely on high interest loans or payday loans, this service can also benefit
current mortgage holders who are struggling to meet regular repayments or who may be in negative equity.

## Structure

 > # Development

 ## Current-Features

Neo-Zapit takes a number of variables input by potential borrowers and investors and aligns their needs based on matching inputs. Neo-Zapit creates a peer to peer network of individuals will to invest in potential borrowers and enables lending across boarders. Machine learning addresses the risk associated with lending and determines an individuals credit worthiness based on a range of factors taken into consideration for our score card model. Our model is based on lending and issuing of fiat for crpyto currency. We aim to provide individuals the opportunity to mitigate price risk through lending fiat + interest for crypto. An example can be used with Neo coin, an individual holds 100 Neo however requires money to pay his upcoming rent. The value of his 100 Neo currently stands at $10,000. Our model will allow an investor to lend this person $1000 + interest of say 10% using 11 Neo as collateral for the loan. The borrower agrees to repay his debt of $1100 to the lender and upon payment receives his 11 Neo in return for full payment. This is managed through a smart contract agreement upon issuance of the Debt and 11 Neo collateral.


## Further-Development

Development of the smart contracts to connect to our platform. We have a front end built which allows users to visit the site. We require further development to achieve our desired functionality. Further discussion is required with individuals who have previous experience in decentralized finance, our model requires further refinement should the value of the 100 Neo in the example above drop below the price of the loan and in turn the borrowers collateral is below the value of the loan and removes the incentive to repay the debt. This can be mitigated through a more centralized approach with connection to credit scoring mechanisms and transparency within the platform.

***Digital Wallet (Zaps)***

The proposed platform will include connection to wallet connect in which users can access their tokens. This eco-system will be
connected to a user's smart-phone and included within the platform itself. Users can store their tokens and spend as appropriate.

> # User-Stories

## First case example user experience

Middle income user who has difficulty meeting loan obligations and struggles with regular savings -

Individual who holds crypto assets requires cash loan to make payment for holiday. User feels asset will rise in value in the short to
medium term. User can trade the asset on exhange for Bitcoin or Ethereum or other asset then pay high fees through crypto bank for cash
and withdraw. Making use of Neo-Zapit user can trade the token they hold for cash at an agreed amount, term, and rate of interest. Withdraw
cash to bank and repay loan over term. During the term of the loan the value of the asset held as collateral increases 2x. The user repays the
loan in full to the lender capital + interest and the asset is released at the original price at the borrower recieved the funds for. The borrower
can then sell of re-loan based on the original agreement being met.

## Second case example user experience

Low income user who is in arrears on mortgage and cannot maintain current levels of debt to salary -

Borrower visits site. Borrower has digital assets of value €1100 which places against a loan as collateral for €1000 + 10% interest. User agrees term of 11 months @ €100 per month. The borrower makes 5 payments of €100. During this period the value of the asset drops to €600, the borrower
decides not to continue with the repayment of the loan. The asset + €500 paid in the 5 monthly installments revert to the lender.

> # Mobile-Application

## Developer comments

Neo-Zapit will continue to develop to include live data for testing purposes.
This will improve time to market and ensure testing of further development for planned functionality with allauth 
for login through google and social media. While the web based application is mobile ready further reach can be achived through Google play 
store and Apple App Store.

> # Business-Plan

## Timeframe

With the aid of development partners we can ensure smooth implementation of user connectivity, specifically 
implantation of PSD2 and planned site development for inclusion of voucher/business eco-system as outlined with
the revenue model. This can be achieved within a 6-8 month period for beta V1. Brand/product recognition will
be completed in conjunction with anticipated release of product launch.

**6 months to Irish market**
**1 year to European market**
**2 global market**

## Costs

**Development**

We require further development of the smart contract functionality.

This cost can be further reduced through incubation development teams. This can allow for further cost allocation to
market the product.

**Marketing**

This will be targeted at our intended demographic age of 18-30 year olds and will be based on social media and relevant platforms initially.
As product/brand awareness improves further marketing management will be required to ensure market penetration is achieved. From research an
average social media marketing campaign can be achieved on €12,000 depending on budget.

## SWOT

- Strengths

Personal finances applications market is an increasing market. Recent analysis by Statista -
(https://www.statista.com/outlook/298/109/personal-finance/united-states)
indicates market growth to over €1 Billion in value by 2023 in the United States alone. A growth of 25%
from its current position.

The system has numerous strengths which include simple user-friendly UI making use of blockchain technology
, dectralized finance and allowing users to leverage their assets.

- Weaknesses (Challenges)

Challenges identified predominantly relate to smart contract development.

- Opportunities

This model is not in practice currently. Lending within the crypto eco-system is not fully adopted however this is an area within
the space which will become more prevalent as the industry matures.

- Threats

Threats relate to similar products. However this is an emerging space within the crypto industry. Threats also relate to the value of
assets reducing leaving investor open to losses, similar to impairement loss currently faced through providing liquidity. Threats also 
relate to individuals not repaying loans upon taking loan. The interest cost being fixed within the original asset collatoral can mitigate this
risk somewhat.

## Revenue Model

The revenue model will be based on a percentage of transaction fees and % of interest charged for issuance of loan for borrower + lenders.
